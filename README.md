PDF files made with LaTeX

LaTeX is a programming language (although some may disagree with this statement) that turns written
code with the extension TeX into PDF files. Developed with the purpose to write high level scientific articles,
LaTeX can be used to write any type of PDF file you want, you just have to know what packages
to use.

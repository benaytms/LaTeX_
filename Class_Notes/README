for the .rnote files you must have the rnote software.
(i tried finding a way to convert to PDF but it was no use)

in case you want it run these commands:
Linux: 
sudo <your-package-manager> install flatpak
flatpak install flathub 
flatpak run com.github.flxzt.rnote


Windows: 
go to https://github.com/flxzt/rnote/releases/tag/v0.10.2
download the .exe
install it.
